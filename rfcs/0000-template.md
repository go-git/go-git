# RFC <Number> <Title>

## Summary

_One paragraph explanation of the change._

## Motivation

_Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?_

## Detailed design

_This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with go-git to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the change is used._

## Drawbacks

_Why should we *not* do this? Consider: implementation complexity, impact on existing users. Interaction with other features. Security and performance implications.

## Rationale and alternatives

_Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs? What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them? What is the impact of not doing this?_
